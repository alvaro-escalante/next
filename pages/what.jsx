  h1 What is React?
  p
    | React, or ReactJS, is a declarative JavaScript library designed as an efficient, flexible route to building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook, instagram and a community of independent developers and businesses. It is open source and provides out of the box developer tools.
  p
    | React offers the possibility of creating rich web applications delivering a fast and efficient experience. The basic idea is that components inform React about what you want to render. React will update and render only those components when your data changes.
  p
    | React is often described in the same way as other Javascript frameworks but this is really misleading. 
    strong React and Angular are not directly comparable entities.
    | Where Angular is a complete framework, React is not. React is a declarative, flexible Javascript Library used to deal 
    strong exclusively with Views
    |  â€” the output of information.
